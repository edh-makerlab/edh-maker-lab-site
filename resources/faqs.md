# Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I operate the 3D printer?
3D printers can only be used by library staff and trained volunteers.

### If I explain my idea, will someone at the library create it for me?
The 3D Print Lab does not have the time or personnel to custom-design projects
for patrons. However, volunteers are more than happy to help anyone who needs
help creating their design.

### Can I print an item with multiple colors?
Items print in one solid color. If your project can be printed in multiple
pieces and then assembled, each of those pieces could be printed in a different
color. Bear in mind that each of these pieces would count as your one item
limit for the month.

### Can I paint 3D printed objects?
Yes! Experts recommend sanding and priming before painting. For best results,
use acrylic paint and primer. See this site for more information.

### Will water damage my project?
No, PLA is safe to submerge in water. If you are intending to use your print as
a vase or container, you may want to apply a waterproof sealant to the inside of
 the container, as printing will sometimes leave very small gaps that water can
 leak through.  

### Is it safe to eat or drink off of PLA?
Eating off of 3D printed objects is not recommended. PLA is non-toxic, but
prints typically leave gaps which can harbor bacteria. Hot water will also melt
PLA, making washing difficult. It is recommended that if you do intend to eat
off of your print that you use a food-grade epoxy to seal the item before using
it.
