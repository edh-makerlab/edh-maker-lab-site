The El Dorado Hills Library 3D Print Lab is funded by a grant from the Serrano
Men's Book Club, including equipment and materials. The lab is run by
volunteers.

If you would like to contribute to the 3D Print Lab, take a look at our [Amazon
wishlist](http://smile.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/34CZIXF1KFKID). Donations
keep the print lab fully stocked and allow library patrons to print for free.

(Remember: place Amazon orders through AmazonSmile, select El Dorado County
Friends of the Library as your charity of choice, .5% of all purchases will go
to the library at no additional cost to you!)
